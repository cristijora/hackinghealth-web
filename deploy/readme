This folder contains 3 files necessary for deployments on heroku.
These should be copied in the dist folder in order for the deployment to work.

-server.js is a node server that will serve the application and handle routing
-package.json is needed in order to specify the necessary dependencies which in this case are: connect-history-api-fallback (route handling)
-Procfile is a heroku deployment file which specifies the commands to be executed so the server can start

In order to make a deploy simply initialize a git repository inside the dist folder with the following origin: https://git.heroku.com/kairy.git
git remote add origin heroku https://git.heroku.com/kairy.git
Then you should be able to commit and trigger deploys based on git pushes

git add . (add all files)
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push heroku master (This will trigger a deployment)
